# IR Sensor Entry-Exit Counter System

This is an **Arduino-based IR Sensor Counter System** to track the number of people entering and exiting a room or space. It uses **two IR sensors** to detect motion and displays the count on the **Serial Monitor** of the Arduino IDE.

## 📦 Features
- Counts entries and exits using two IR sensors.
- Displays real-time count on the Serial Monitor.
- Ensures count does not go negative.
- Simple and effective for small room monitoring.

## 🖥️ Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- 2x IR Sensors
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## 📂 Code Files
- `in_out.ino` → Main Arduino sketch

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Connect your IR sensors to digital pins as defined in the code.
2. Open **Arduino IDE** and select the correct board and port.
3. Upload the sketch.
4. Open **Serial Monitor** (`Ctrl + Shift + M`) to view the count in real-time.
